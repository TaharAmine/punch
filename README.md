This wasn't written by me. It was taken from the book Building Open Source
Network Security Tools by Mike Schiffman. I have changed some of the formatting
and typos in comments, but it is largely untouched.

The original source is still available from the book's companion website.

I have created this repository for reference/academic reasons.
